                    <h4>The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is a high-end graphics card produced by Nvidia. The 4090 offers 16,384 of the 18,432 cores and 24 GB GDDR6X
                        graphics memory with a 384 bit memory bus and clocked at 21 Gbits. The card offers an excellent
                        raytracing performance thanks to the 128 dedicated raytracing cores. For AI calculations (and
                        DLSS 3 in games), the RTX 4090 has 512 Tensor cores.
                        The gaming performance is very well suited for 4k gaming in maximum detail settings. Even
                        Raytracing effects can be used without DLSS in most games.</h4>
